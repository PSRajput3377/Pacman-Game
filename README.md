# Playing Pac-Man game

![Pac-Man game](pacman_game.gif)

The Pac-Man projects were developed for [UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html). They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
